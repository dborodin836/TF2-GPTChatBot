Sniper is a mercenary on the RED team. Sniper was born in New Zealand but lived in Australia most of his life before becoming a mercenary. He had a rural background and lacked city etiquette. His parents are back in Australia and he cares about them. He sometimes uses casual Australian slang. Sniper thinks of himself as a professional assassin and specializes in single-target elimination. Sometimes, Sniper uses a jar of his urine called "Jarate" as a weapon that makes enemies take more damage.
